## 1\.  Your Agreement with Aspose

**1.1** Your use of the Aspose Cloud API is governed by this agreement (the "Terms"). "Aspose" means Aspose Pty Ltd, located at Suite 163, 79 Longueville Road, Lane Cove, NSW, 2066, Australia, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Aspose Cloud API Service. The “Services” means the services Aspose makes available through this website, including this website, the Aspose Cloud API, any Aspose Add-ons, and any other software or services offered by Aspose in connection to any of those. The "Application" or collectively "Applications" is any web application that you create using the Aspose Cloud API and any source code written by you to be used with the Aspose Cloud API. The "User" means yourself, the individual or company who uses our Service to create Applications.

**1.2** The Aspose Cloud API or “Service” is the publicly available Aspose Application Programming Interface (“API”) as well as the related API Documentation available at [http://www.aspose.cloud](http://www.aspose.cloud/). In order to use this you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the API service. You understand and agree that Aspose will treat your use of the Aspose Cloud API as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

**1.3** You may not use the Aspose Cloud API if you are a person barred from receiving the service under the laws of Australia or other jurisdictions, including the country in which you are resident or which you use the Aspose Cloud API. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Aspose Cloud API is not intended for children under 13.

**1.4** You agree your purchases of the Aspose Cloud API are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Aspose or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

**2.3** You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Aspose Cloud API by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Aspose in connection with the Aspose Cloud API, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Aspose, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Aspose Cloud API (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

**2.4** Aspose provides you with the ability to review, correct and delete any of the Personal Information that you have provided to us via the dashboard. We may limit or deny access to your Personal Information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by applicable laws or regulations.

**2.5** Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Aspose Cloud API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Aspose, at its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. The Company will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension. Repeated exceeding of the usage limits may lead to termination of your account.

**2.7** Aspose processes your Personal Information in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by you, the individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that your Personal Information is accurate, complete, current and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use.

We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your Personal Information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

## 4\.  Fees for Use of the Aspose Cloud API

**4.1** Subject to the Terms, the Aspose Cloud API is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services.

**4.2** For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Aspose fees and payment policies, if different. Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Aspose's measurements of your use of the Aspose Cloud API, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Aspose. Nothing in these Terms obligates Aspose to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Aspose may be shared by Aspose with companies who work on Aspose's behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of effecting payment to Aspose and servicing your account. Aspose shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Aspose reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Aspose Cloud API to you for any late payments.

**4.3** We reserve the right to change the structure of our pricing plan or introduce other plans at any time without further notice. Where possible we will attempt to "grandfather" these plans so you can stay on the plan you are on and so you are not affected by any major changes however this is not guaranteed. Aspose may change its fees and payment policies for the Aspose Cloud API by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website or newsletter (or such other URL Aspose may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.

**4.4** The pricing for the service which can be found at the [Pricing Page](https://purchase.aspose.cloud/pricing) (or such URL as Aspose may provide) covers each individual file provided by you to the service up to 20MB.

**4.5** You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Aspose Cloud API in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

Upon termination, Aspose will store the User's data for a period of 7 days, should the User wish to reopen the Account to resume the use of the Aspose's Service or to export data, unless instructed otherwise by the User.

**11.4 Unlawful Client Data**. Aspose is not obliged to pre-screen, monitor or filter any User Data or acts of its processing by the User in order to discover any unlawful nature therein.
